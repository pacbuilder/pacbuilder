High piority:
* Improve flags handling system, following the one used by pacman/makepkg.
  I would like to install with "pacbuilder -S" and do an upgrade with -Su

Medium priority:
* Gettext support
* Add an option file under /etc
  [easy to do, just do a "source /etc/pacbuilder.conf" and grab the variables]

Low priority:
* Save the makedependencies to unistall under /var/log/something, so if you
  reboot your computer, you can still remove the makedependencies
* Provide a PKGBUILD for this package, and commit here
* write something in the googlecode's project wiki
