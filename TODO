High piority:

Medium priority:
* Must handle versioning checks for the dependencies
  [ edit: should work better for the upgrade]

Low priority:
* Save the makedependencies to unistall under /var/log/something, so if you
  reboot your computer, you can still remove the makedependencies
* write something in the googlecode's project wiki
